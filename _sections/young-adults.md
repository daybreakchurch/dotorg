[Daybreak Young Adults](http://daybreakchurch.org/young-adults/) (NCYA) is a collective community of young adults (18-30) gathering together to create a home for the young adults of North County San Diego. We want every young adult to experience the radical hope and healing of Jesus through personal relationship, communal living, and the simplicity of day to day life. Join us on Monday Nights at 7pm at the chapel!
