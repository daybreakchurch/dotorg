    ## New to Daybreak?

    Going to a new place can be a little uncomfortable for some people, especially if you don't know what to expect. So let us give you a brief run-down of some things you'll experience during your visit to Daybreak.

    Each weekend service lasts about an hour. We begin with a time of singing and worshiping God, hear a message straight out of the Bible, and then wrap things up by praying together. You’re invited to come as you are—no need to dress up!

    ##### Tips for your first visit

    * When you arrive on campus you'll be guided-in by one of our friendly parking attendants. Pro-tip: Come a little early and beat the traffic.

    * If you have kids visit Family Check-In, next to the fountain, and sign your family in. From there one of our volunteers will walk each of your kids to their classroom.

    * Speaking of kids, we have super fun age-appropriate classrooms for your kids. They will play games, sing and have their own teaching time.
