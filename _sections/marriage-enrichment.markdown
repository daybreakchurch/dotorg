STAYING IN LOVE
Falling in love is easy. But staying in love requires a plan.

Join us for a 5-week study, Staying in Love by Andy Stanley. Is it possible for two people to fall in love and actually stay there? Absolutely! Let Andy show you how in this 5-week, video-based study with small group discussion.

Class will meet ONLINE on Tuesday evenings (7:00-8:30p) beginning September 22. Cost is $25/couple.
