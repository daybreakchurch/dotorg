    ###### Daybreak Kids is our exciting Children’s Ministry here at Daybreak Church.

    DK is a place where fun, creativity, and the Bible come to life. We will provide your children with the opportunity to develop and grow spiritually in a safe environment. Kids love the hands-on activities, and multimedia teaching. Our Children’s staff and volunteers are the best and most experienced you will find. You can rest assured that your children will be loved and taken care of in a safe, secure, and exciting environment designed just for them, all while learning about Jesus!
