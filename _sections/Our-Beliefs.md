- text: "##### The Bible\nWe affirm the Holy Bible as the inspired
    Word of God, and as the only basis for our beliefs.  The Bible was written by
    men who were inspired and is God’s revelation of Himself to man. It has God for
    its author, salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture of error for
    its matter. Scripture speaks with the authority of God and reflects the backgrounds,
    styles and vocabularies of the human author. (2 Timothy 3:1-17, 2 Peter 1:19-21)
    \n\n##### God the Father\nWe believe that the eternal God reveals Himself to us
    as the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit; each of whom are equal in all attributes
    of deity. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. (Deuteronomy
    6:4, Matthew 6:9, John 4:24 and 5:26) \n\n##### God the Son\nJesus Christ is the
    eternal Son of God. In His incarnation He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and
    born of a virgin. Jesus perfectly did the will of God. We also believe in His
    sinless life, His substitutionary atonement, His bodily resurrection from the
    dead, His ascension into Heaven, His priestly intercession on behalf of His people,
    and His return in power and glory. (John 6:11, 19; John 12:13; Mark 1:1) "
- text: "  \n\n##### God the Holy Spirit\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God.
    He convicts of sin, calls us to the Savior, empowers believers, and bestows spiritual
    gifts. (Matthew 28:19; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 6:11, 19; 1 Corinthians 12:13;
    Ephesians 3:16)\n\n##### Salvation\n\nSalvation involves the redemption of the
    whole person, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and
    Savior. It is the work of God’s free grace, not the result of human goodness.
    When God has begun a saving work in the heart of a person, He gives assurance
    in His word that He will continue performing it until the day of its full consummation."
