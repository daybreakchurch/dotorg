Our next baptism is coming up on June 2nd during the 8:30a, 10:00a and 11:30a services. If you are a follower of Jesus Christ and have not yet been baptized, we encourage you to take a step of obedience and be baptized. Adult inquiries should be directed to Laura at [laura@daybreakchurch.org](laura@daybreakchurch.org).

IMPORTANT: If your elementary aged child, between 3rd and 5th grade, would like to be baptized they will meet with Pastor Christa prior to being baptized. The deadline to contact Christa to set up an appointment is May 19th. This class is required for all children to help prepare them for baptism. Pastor Christa will contact you to schedule a time to meet with your child. Children's inquiries can be directed to Christa Katona at [christa@daybreakchurch.org](christa@daybreakchurch.org).
