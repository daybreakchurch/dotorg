Happy Easter! In our last series we learned about how to be a Super Fan of God so that others can know who he is by how we treat others. This weekend, beginning with why Easter is the most important day to remember and that God used Easter to make peace with us, his people, we are staring a series called, "Reconnect"! This series is all about Peace. For this series, peace is being defined as proving that you care more about others than winning the argument. 

We have been so blessed to be invited to share the love of Jesus in your homes through our videos. This week's video lesson will be the last one we will have available at this time. Please join us in person to learn how to make peace a priority in your life and those around you.

*"So let us do all we can to live in peace. And let us work hard to build up on another." Romans 14:19 NIrV*
