What is Financial Peace University?
It’s the surprisingly fun class that teaches you how to:

* Pay off debt
* Budget
* Save money
* Build wealth
* Give generously

You shouldn’t feel overwhelmed and powerless over your money. You can be in control of your money and your future!

Join us for 10-weeks of class starting **Monday, September 13th, 6:00-8:00p**. There is a fee for class materials, which can be purchased through registration.
