If you have lost a spouse, child, family member or friend, you’ve probably found there are not many people who understand the deep hurt you feel. You don’t have to go through the grieving process alone. GriefShare offers a biblical approach to grief recovery and the return to emotional health. Each session includes a video seminar, group discussion and journaling/workbook exercises. Among many others, you will find answers to the following questions:

* Is it okay for me to grieve?

* How long will my grief last?

* How do I deal with these overwhelming emotions?

* How should I handle the big decisions that need to
  be made?

The group will meet **online** Thursday mornings from 10:00am -11:30am for 13 weeks beginning January 28, 2021. You may join the class at any time during the 13 weeks. There is a $15
fee for materials.
