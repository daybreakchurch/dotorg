Lovely Ladies!

Join us **April 30 & May 1** on our campus for a very special weekend. We are excited to welcome our keynote speaker Rebekah Lyon’s, a national speaker and the bestselling author of Rhythms of Renewal and You are Free. Rebekah will be speaking on how we can trade our stress and anxiety for a life of peace and purpose. 

We will also discover together what it means & what it looks like to be truly “AVAILABLE” to God.

This weekend will be all things “LOVELY”. We will have fun, food, friends, laughter and a time of connecting with our heavenly Father.

This event is for High School Students and up.

Register now! Cost now is $139; price will increase to $159 on April 12.

Cost for Military and Students is $109.00

There will be both indoor and outdoor seating available. Indoor seating will be based on current guidelines.
