**Our next Baby Dedication will be on June 6th 2021.**

Baby Dedication is a special service where parents make a commitment to help their kids find and follow Jesus, and the Daybreak family makes a commitment to stand with the parents and support them in this journey. Our kids matter! As parents, it's our responsibility to help our kids grow in their faith...but it's a BIG responsibility!

All spots have been filled for this Sunday, June 6. If you are interested in having your baby dedicated at the next opportunity, please let us know by clicking below.

Please contact Deby at deby@daybreakchurch.org with any questions.
