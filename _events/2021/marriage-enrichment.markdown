Marriage should be a source of joy to both husband and wife, and a source of strength, confidence, and encouragement to all the members of the family.  God intended it to be an awe-inspiring, intimate, fruitful, joyous relationship - in short, life-giving!
Whether you are just about to begin your marriage or have been working on yours for decades, Marriage Enrichment classes will help you keep your marriage healthy, vibrant and Christ-centered.  

Our class sessions meet two to three times per year.
