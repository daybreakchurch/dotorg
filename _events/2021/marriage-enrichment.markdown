Falling in love is easy. But staying in love requires a plan.

Join us for a 6-week study, **Staying in Love** **by Andy Stanley**. Is it possible for two people to fall in love and actually stay there? Absolutely! Let Andy show you how in this five-week, video-based study with small group discussion.

Join us for 6-weeks of class starting Tuesday, September 14th, 7:00-8:30p. There is a fee for class materials, which can be purchased through registration.

For more information, contact Melissa at 760.505.6186.
