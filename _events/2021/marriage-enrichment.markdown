Falling in love is easy. But staying in love requires a plan.

Join us for a 5-week study, **Staying in Love** **by Andy Stanley**. Is it possible for two people to fall in love and actually stay there? Absolutely! Let Andy show you how in this five-week, video-based study with small group discussion.

Join us in the Fall for the next session of Marriage Enrichment.
