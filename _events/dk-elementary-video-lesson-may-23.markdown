Paul and Silas knew the importance of having Jesus' truth in their lives and also understood that in order for them to spread this truth, there would be some opposition from those who did not understand. When they find themselves imprisoned, they choose joy over the sorrow of the cold jail cell and freshly beaten wounds. Through the choice of singing praises to God, many lives were changed that day. Please enjoy this lesson on the importance of choosing joy even through times of hardship and sorrow.
