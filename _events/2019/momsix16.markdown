You're invited to join moms of school age kids to experience Godly community in order to strengthen, equip and encourage you.  Dress casually as we seek God's Word together through responsible communication, kindness and the freedom found when comparisons are left at the door.  We'll meet on Wednesday evenings from 6:30-8:00p.  Bring another mom to be encouraged, too!
