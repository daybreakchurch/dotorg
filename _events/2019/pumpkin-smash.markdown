If you’re in mid school or high school you won’t want to miss this day-before-Halloween party. Come dressed up (modestly) in your favorite costume. We’ll have live music by Mainsail, pumpkin smashing with the sledge-o-matic, candy buffet, prizes, giveaways and more. Bring yourself and any friends who love fun.
