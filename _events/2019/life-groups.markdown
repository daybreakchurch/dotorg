At Daybreak Church, we believe in the value of community. Spiritual growth hinges upon a believer being connected to both God and his/her family while in community. Life Groups are an ideal place to experience spiritual growth as members study the Bible, pray together and just share life. We have Life Groups meeting every day of the week in many locations throughout North County and new groups are formed on a regular basis. There are many types of groups from which to choose including men, women, couples, single parents, young adults, 50+ and more.
