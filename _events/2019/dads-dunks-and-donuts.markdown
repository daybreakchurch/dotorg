This is a can’t miss, free event for the entire family, celebrating Dad on Father’s Day weekend! Come to Daybreak from 9:00-11:00a (or anytime in between) for donuts (over 1,000 to choose from!), jump houses, an inflatable obstacle course, rock wall, face painting and best of all, the opportunity to be dunked or dunk a fellow Dad in ice-cold water.
