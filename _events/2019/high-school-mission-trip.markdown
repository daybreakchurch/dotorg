The high school ministry of Daybreak is embarking on an international mission trip to Guatemala this summer from July 8-17.  We are partnering with Daybreak missionaries Dany and Kimberly Mejia and Living Waters ministry. Students will have the opportunity to work with orphans, teach students about God, and share their own faith. This is sure to be a faith building, life-changing experience!
