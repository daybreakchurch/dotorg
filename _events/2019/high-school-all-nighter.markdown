Don’t our first ever ALL NIGHTER on Friday, April 12 to Saturday, April 13. We’ll be staying up all night, traveling by bus around San Diego. The night includes roller skating, blacklight bowling, a midnight snack stop, broomball, laser tag, and more! $55 includes transportation, all attractions, and breakfast. Invite your friends to this epic event!

Students are to arrive at Daybreak by 7:30p on Friday night and will return to Daybreak the next morning at 8:00a. Extra spending money is encouraged for our midnight stop at the grocery store (snacks and drinks). Waiver must be signed and returned to Pastor Shea for registration to be considered complete.
