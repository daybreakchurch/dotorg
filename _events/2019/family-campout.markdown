Our 14th Annual Family Campout at Dos Picos County Park is just around the corner. Dos Picos is near Ramona, within one hour of Carlsbad, with shaded sites, clean bathrooms and hot showers – camping at its most challenging (not really). Along with the infamous Saturday games and evening potluck, there is a playground for the kids, hiking, bike riding, horseshoes, campfires and s’mores. Tents, RVs and pop-ups welcome. Cost is $80 per family (non-refundable). Event sells out every year so register soon!
