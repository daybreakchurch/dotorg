Join us every month for Daybreak Mommies Monthly (DMM). It's a great opportunity for mommies with young children (Pre-K and under) to receive practical, Christ-centered parenting instruction from guest speakers, connect with other moms, and encourage one another through round table discussions guided by mentor moms. We begin at 9:00a and will be serving a wonderful breakfast, too. No registration necessary and you are encouraged to bring another mommy friend or neighbor with you. Childcare is available for ages birth through Pre-K for a small fee. Please contact Melissa at 808.264.8930 or <mommiesmonthly@daybreakchurch.org> for more information.
