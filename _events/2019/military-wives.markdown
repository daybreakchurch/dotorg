Join us at Daybreak every month from 6:00-8:00p for a delicious meal (no charge), support and fun with other military wives and active duty women. This group is intended to offer Biblical encouragement and community to women throughout North County who face the challenges of deployment, moving and the daily stress of being "married to the military". Kids will be treated to their own meal and childcare is provided at no charge (ages birth-10 years).
