Grab a buddy and hang out with us on Monday, April 8, starting at 6:00p to watch the NCAA basketball championship game. $15 gets you access to all you can eat gourmet build-your-own burger bar, 3 giant HD screens and the first 150 guys get the new Anchoredman swag. Don't forget to bring a lawn chair and something savory or sweet to share. And like always, if this is your first Anchoredman event, you get in for free! See you there.
