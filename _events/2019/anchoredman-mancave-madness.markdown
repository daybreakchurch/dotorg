Grab a buddy and hang out with us on Monday, September 9, starting at 6:30p to watch the first Monday Night football game. $15 gets you access to food and the first 150 guys get the new Anchoredman swag. Don't forget to bring a lawn chair and something savory or sweet to share. And like always, if this is your first Anchoredman event, you get in for free! See you there.
