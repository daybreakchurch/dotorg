We welcome you into the perfect opportunity to stay connected to the very community that God has you in with this 7-week study. Join us as we learn Godâ€™s Word through Priscilla Shirer study Armor of God, more than merely a biblical description of the believer's inventory, it is an action plan for putting it on and developing a personalized strategy to secure victory. We will gather in small groups to encourage one another in this safe and very loving environment.

You can choose to attend the morning group from 9:00-11:00a or the evening one from 6:30-8:30p; both are on Thursdays at Daybreak. Cost is $40; payment is required with registration. Childcare is available for ages birth-Pre-K (morning) and ages 2-10 (evening) for a small fee. Save $20 by choosing the prepayment option.
