We want to invite you to a Bible study experience tailored just for you. This is a 7-week study and we’ve scheduled around most spring breaks so you won’t have to miss a single week. We welcome you into the perfect opportunity to stay connected to the very community that God has you in. Join us as we study God’s Word through Lysa Terkeurst’s brand new study, It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way. As we all wrestle with disappointment and painful struggle in our lives, this study will lead you to fresh Biblical insight. It will shed light on life-giving perspective to grow your faith in Christ’s love and enduring strength. We will gather in small groups to encourage one another in this safe and very loving environment.

You can choose to attend the morning group from 9:00-11:00a or the evening one from 6:30-8:30p; both are on Thursdays at Daybreak. Cost is $40; payment is required with registration. Childcare is available for ages birth-Pre-K (morning) and ages 2-10 (evening) for a small fee. Save $20 by choosing the prepayment option.
