SeaWorldâ€™s premier water park is filled with incredible water slides, lazy lagoons, and wave pools! This is an awesome way to close out the summer before school starts! $40 includes park admission and transportation to and from Daybreak. Student drop off/check-in is 8:45 am. We will return to Daybreak Church at 7:00 pm.

A waiver must be signed and turned into Daybreak Church for registration to be complete. Lunch is not provided so your student will need to bring extra money for lunch in the park.
