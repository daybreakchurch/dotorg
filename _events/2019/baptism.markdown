Our summer beach baptism is scheduled for the afternoon of Sunday, September 8th at Ponto Beach in Carlsbad. If you are a follower of Jesus Christ and have not yet been baptized, we encourage you to take a step of obedience and be baptized!

INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE 6th GRADE TO ADULTS: There will be a Baptism Class on September 8th, at church at 10:00a in the Upper North Room, located next to the chapel above the main auditorium. ENTER FROM THE UPPER PARKING LOT.

INFORMATION FOR CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 6th GRADE: If you are signing up your child (3rd to 5th grade) to be baptized, please contact Pastor Christa, at [christa@daybreakchurch.org](christa@daybreakchurch.org) or 760.931.7773 x21 to schedule a time for you and your child to meet with her. Christa meets personally with all children being baptized prior to the baptism. The deadline to meet with Christa is August 25th. This class is required for all children to help prepare them for baptism.
