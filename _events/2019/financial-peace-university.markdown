###### Imagine yourself debt free - with no more worrying about paying the bills.

Imagine if you and your spouse stopped fighting about money. Imagine teaching your children by example how to manage God’s gifts.  This class is the first step to having those things!

During this life-changing class, you will learn how to take control of your money, stop struggling to make ends meet and change your family’s future. Proverbs 22:7 states that “...the borrower is slave to the lender.” Are you ready to take the first step? Join us for our next nine-week class.

Classes meet at Daybreak on Monday evenings from 6:00–8:00p beginning September 24th.

Please come to the first night for a free preview. After the first class, course kit is required to be purchased for this class and is available through the link below for $109, through the DaveRamsey.Com store for $129, or a few kits will be available on the first night of class for $109.
