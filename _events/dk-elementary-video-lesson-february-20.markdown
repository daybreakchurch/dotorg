We had so much fun with you indoors this past weekend and look forward to continue it this week with Birthday Club! If your birthday is in February join us for a celebration of all of our February birthdays. A couple weeks ago, the adults were given a bookmark with ways to pray for the mission Daybreak Church partners with in Haiti. This week Daybreak Elementary will be introduced to the mission and given their very own handout on how they can be praying for the kids in Haiti. 

Remember to skip right past the Amphitheater and come on over to the colorful polka dots in front of the Student Center to check in beginning 15 minutes prior to each service time.
