This week, finder fish, you will learn how to share Jesus. In Acts 2 we learn about when the Holy Spirit came like the sound of rushing wind giving power to the disciples who were gathered to share the good news of Jesus with everyone! Peter was brave and when he told the people about Jesus, about 3,000 people decided to follow him and were baptized. Jesus wants you to tell people about him too! You can share Jesus by telling your friends Jesus loves them, invite them to church and loving others.
