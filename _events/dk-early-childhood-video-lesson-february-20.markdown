Did you know that you can tell God anything and anytime you want? He is always listening and wants to know everything you have to share with him. Philippians tells us that whether we are sad, happy or worried, we should always talk to God. No matter what, tell God about everything! Do you have your Bible with you now? In Matthew 7, Jesus tells us that when we ask, seek and knock God is always listening and hears us.

*â€œAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you." Matthew 7:7*
