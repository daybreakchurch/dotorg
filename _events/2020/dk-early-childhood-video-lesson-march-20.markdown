So far, we have learned with Pastor Nicola and Slider that God is our Lord! He is so powerful. God is our Shepherd and even David was a shepherd boy before he was a king. This weekend we find out how God is our Defender. When Daniel prayed to God instead of bowing to the king of the land he lived in, he was thrown into a den filled with hungry lions. Those lions wanted to eat whatever entered their den and Daniel was next but God sent an angel to shut the mouth of those lions and Daniel was protected all night long! Just like God protected Daniel, he also protects us because God is our Defender!
