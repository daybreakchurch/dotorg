Everywhere we look, we can spy things God made! He made the animals, all of space, and all the people too. When Paul went to Athens he told the people that God made the world and everything in it. He told them that God even made them and gave them Jesus to be their friend forever and many understood him and believed because everyone can believe in Jesus! Enjoy this week's video lesson together and spend some time spying things that God made!
