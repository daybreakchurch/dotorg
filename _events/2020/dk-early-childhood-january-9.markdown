This week we learn all about the time when Jesus was sleeping on a boat with his disciples and a great storm hit. Everyone except Jesus was very afraid and thought the boat would sink. Jesus asked them why they were afraid and didn't have faith that God would keep them safe. He told the winds to be calm. Find out what happened to that storm. Jesus is not only in charge of being kind and loving others, He is in charge of everything! Open your Bibles and read the story you hear together as a family after service!

*â€œThe disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are going to drown! He replied, 'You of little faith, why are you so afraid?' Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves," Matthew 8:25-26a*

**This week, make one of the craft options we have attached and remember that Jesus is in control of everything!**
