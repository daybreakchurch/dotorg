We are starting a new series called, "Block Party", where we will learn that everyone is invited into Jesus' community and friendship is important. This week we discover that it is important to choose your friends carefully. When you have the right friends, you will get more done, you will help each other, stand up for each other and most importantly, you will be able to help each other trust God! In Ecclesiastes, Solomon tells us the importance that two are better than one. We will learn what a true friend looks like and be reminded that Jesus is our ultimate friend who will never leave you.

*"Two are better than one," - Ecclesiastes 4:9a*
