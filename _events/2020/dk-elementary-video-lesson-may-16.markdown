Saul was a hunter of Christians whose life was completely transformed by God and became one of the greatest leaders during the start of the church. Ananias was a disciple used by God even when he was afraid to go to the man who could have him killed. This week, kids will learn that God has the power to change our lives and also uses us to change the lives of others!
