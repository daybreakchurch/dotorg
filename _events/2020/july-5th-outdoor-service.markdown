##### Enter The Gates

My eyes on Your faithfulness
O God let me not forget to sing in the valley
To look toward Your goodness

My heart set on who You are
You're the light that consumes the dark
The joy and the strength
To lift up my hands and sing

I enter the gates with nothing but thanks
I want to magnify Your worth
I want to bring You more than words
I enter the gates come reckless with praise
I'll bring a heart that wants You first
All for Your glory

My feet on the battleground
My weapon will be my sound
I will not be silent my song is my triumph
Sing my soul will sing
My soul will make this place an altar Make this place an altar

##### God of the Promise

Not gonna wait, wait for the walls to fall
I know a name that will bring them down
I've got a praise, waking within my soul
I'm not ashamed to declare it now

Light of the world, trample the darkness
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Every word will be accomplished
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise

Prepare the way, the King of Glory comes
Before His name, every fear must bow
Throw off your chains, Jesus destroyed them all
Up from the grave, He is with us now

Light of the world, trample the darkness
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Every word will be accomplished
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise

The gates of hell will never stand a chance
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
No word will fail, no weapon formed against
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am

The gates of hell will never stand a chance
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
No word will fail, no weapon formed against
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am

Light of the world, trample the darkness
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Every word will be accomplished
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise

##### King of My Heart

Let the King of my heart 
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from 
Oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song

'Cause You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh

And let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh, He is my song

'Cause You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, ohâ€¦

##### Build My Life 

Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you

Jesus a name above every other name
Jesus the only one that could ever save

Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you
We live for you

Holy there is no one like you
There is none beside you
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who you are
And fill me with your heart
And lead me in your love
to those around me

I will build my life, upon your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust, in you alone
And I will not be shaken
