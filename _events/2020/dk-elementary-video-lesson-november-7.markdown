Sometimes we might be nervous that if we show the real us, others might not like us but with God, we never have to hide. We all make mistakes and it might seem easier to hide and not admit them but as time goes on, we feel worse than if we confess right away. Even though God knows the mistakes we make, he wants to hear from us. He wants to hear our sweet voices talking to him. 1 John 1:9 tells us that God is faithful and fair. If we confess our sins he will forgive and make us pure. Watch this week’s video lesson and remember that being truthful with God keeps you close to him.

*“But God is faithful and fair. If we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins. He will forgive every wrong thing we have done. He will make us pure.” 1 John 1:9*
