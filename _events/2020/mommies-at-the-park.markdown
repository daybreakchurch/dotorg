Being a mom of young kids is amazing, but it can also leave you feeling isolated, especially in these unique times. This group offers a place for you to find fellowship, support and build friendships with other moms. 

With parks currently closed, we will be planning on meeting twice a month to connect for walks along the coast until parks open back up again. So feel free to strap your kiddos in a stroller, baby carrier or scooter and meet us on the following dates at the designated location. We need each other now more than ever! We look forward to walking and talking with you! 

**September 22nd at 10:00 AM**
Location: Carlsbad Sea Wall (meet on the grass next to the Harbor Fish Cafe) 

**October 13th at 10:00 AM**
Location: Cardiff (meet at Swami's State Beach. Parking on K street or along 101.)

We typically have park meet-up days on two Tuesdays each month at 10:00a.  We will release more dates on an ongoing basis, so be sure to check back!
