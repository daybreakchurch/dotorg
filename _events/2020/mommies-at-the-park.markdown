Being a mom of young kids is amazing, but it can also leave you feeling isolated, especially in these unique times. This group offers a place for you to find fellowship, support and build friendships with other moms. 

We are so excited that some parks are open again!  Please meet us at the locations below for some fellowship and to let our kiddos play!  We will be practicing social distancing while embracing the chance to see each other. We need each other now more than ever, so hope you can make it!

**Tuesday, November 10th at 10:00** AM Location: Aviara Park

**Tuesday, December 8th at 10:00 AM** Location: Poinsettia Park
