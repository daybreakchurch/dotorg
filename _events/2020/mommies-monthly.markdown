Please join us for a special ZOOM Daybreak Mornings for Moms, Tuesday, May 5th from 9:00-10:30am.  Even though we cannot gather as a large group, we still want to reunite for our final meeting of this 2019-2020 school year!  Your heart, well-being, and spiritual health is so important to us that we want to remain committed to bringing you Godly wisdom, encouragement and hope during this challenging time.    

Come listen to pastor and speaker, Dawn Neldon, share her message, "Living Life to the Fullest when Life Doesn't Go as Planned."  Dawn's desire is to share with you her passion for mothering and living life to the full even when we catch ourselves thinking, "my life wasn't suppose to look like this!" Maybe during this time of quarantine you have felt the helplessness of losing control and the anxiety that follows?  Mom, you are not alone.  Come listen to Dawn share her message of hope, resilience, and finding Godâ€™s purpose for your life during these "crazy times" we find ourselves in.         

Come as you are (even in your pajamas), grab your coffee, and throw some cheerios in front of the kids with their favorite show.  Login with your phone/iPad/laptop and connect with us for some time of worship, a fun game (with prizes!), an encouraging message from our speaker, and special announcements from your Daybreak Mornings for Moms leadership!   

There is no RSVP necessary, but please be respectful by following the ZOOM gathering etiquette:  - Please mute or turn off you microphone when you log in.  This feature is located on the bottom left of your screen. - Make sure your camera is on a steady surface to prevent shaking.   - Turn off your camera if you need to take care of business or your kid(s) outside of the gathering.  Turn the camera back on when you are present in the gathering again.     

We are confident you will leave feeling refreshed and encouraged!  Please contact Melissa at 808.264.8930 or morningsformoms@daybreakchurch.org with questions.
