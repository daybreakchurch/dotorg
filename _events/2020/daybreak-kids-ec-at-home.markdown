We miss you all so much and can't wait until we can meet again:) We are continuing to lift you up during this challenging time. If you or anyone you know has a need please let us know. 

Galatians 6:9

We have part 2 of our lesson "Follow the Leader", how to be a follower of Jesus!

Our lyrics to our song are pasted below if you'd like to print out.  

Sing to the tune of
"Yes, Jesus Loves Me"

Jesus called them one by one
Peter, Andrew, James and John,
Next, came Phillip, Thomas too,
Matthew and Bartholomew

Chorus-
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
He called them one by one

James the one they called the less,
Simon, also Thaddeus
Twelfth apostle Judas made
Jesus was by him betrayed

Chorus-
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
He called them one by one 

Matthias then took Judas' place
To preach to men of every race,
Paul three preaching trips did make
And went to Rome for Jesus' sake

Chorus-
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
Yes Jesus called them
He called them one by one
