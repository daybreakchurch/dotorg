Hello Parents,

Yes, here we are with another week of shelter in place. Please know that the Daybreak Kids team are here for you during this season. Keeping a sense of "normal" with kiddos and church is crucial during this time and we applaud you as you participate in these lessons with your children.

Way to go parents!!!

Our prayer is that during this time you are drawing closer to Jesus! He is our Rock! This verse has been encouraging to me this past week.

Psalm 62:5-6 


This Sunday we will be learning about the "Triumphal Entry" as we lead up to Easter Sunday. Look in your backyard or walk your neighborhood for some palm leaves, but, be careful of the ones with spikey parts.

As always, if you have any questions or we can support you in any way please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
God Bless you all!
