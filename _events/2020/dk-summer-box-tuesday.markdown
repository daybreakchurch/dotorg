Spending time with God each day is a huge part of our relationship with him. Through time in his Word, we can know him more and learn how to go through life! Grab your "My Bible Study" sheet from your box and spend some time with God.

*"Jesus answered, "It is written:'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.""*
