Have you experienced the pain of a separation or divorce? Looking for help and healing? It’s a confusing time when you feel isolated and have lots of questions about issues you’ve never faced before. In this class, you’ll gain access to valuable resources to help you with the pain of the past and find hope for the future. Each session includes a video, group discussion and workbook/journaling exercises.

The group will meet online Tuesday nights from 6:30pm-8:00pm for 13 weeks beginning February 2, 2021. You may join the class at any time during the 13 weeks. There is a $20 fee for materials.
