Faith is believing in what you can't see because of what you can see. This week we start a series called Focus and will be taking a closer look into what we believe. The book of Hebrews in the Bible tells us about the many believers who trusted God and did what he asked them to do, even though many of God's promises would not be fulfilled in their own lifetime. These believers continued to be faithful knowing that they were living out a promise for those who came after them because God's plan was much bigger than them. Today, when we can trust God in faith and live our life based on how Jesus lived, others will see His love poured out through us.
