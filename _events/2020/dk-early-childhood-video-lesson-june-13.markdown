The Bible tells us that Jesus was a friend to everyone when he lived on earth! He was a friend to people different than him and those who made bad choices, like a man named Zacchaeus. Today, Jesus is a friend to me and you too because when he died on the cross, he rose again so everyone can believe in him.
