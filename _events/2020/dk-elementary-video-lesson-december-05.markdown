This week we will learn about when Mary, an ordinary girl from Nazareth, was visited by an angel from the Lord and told her some amazing news! She was going to become pregnant with a special child. This child was told of many years before and to confirm this promise, her cousin, who could not have children in her old age, Elizabeth also had a message from the Lord and was pregnant with a very special miracle baby who was filled with the Holy Spirit. She knew God had a plan for the world and was overwhelmed with the understanding that God was going to use her to help fulfill this plan. Watch this week’s video lesson and learn that God also has a plan for you.

*“But the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.’” -Luke 1:30-31*
