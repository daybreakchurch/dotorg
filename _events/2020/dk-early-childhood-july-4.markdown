Peter was a very good friend of Jesus and he loved him very much but on the night Jesus died on the cross, Peter did something wrong. He told three people he didn't know who Jesus was because he was afraid of what they might think of him. We will learn that even though Peter made a mistake, Jesus still loved Peter no matter what. Jesus forgave Peter for his mistakes and Peter went on to tell everyone he saw about Jesus, they believed and became Jesus' forever friend! Everyone can believe in Jesus!
