Hello Daybreak Family,

If you are like me, you love driving onto the Daybreak Campus on Sunday mornings. However, you are probably wondering what will happen given the current events in our world. I’d like to take a few minutes of your time to update you on what’s happening at Daybreak as we prepare for the impact of the Corona Virus in our region.

As you know by now, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order suspending public gatherings of 250 people or more. Today, we are implementing an action plan at Daybreak to ensure we are able to continue to proclaim the truth of Jesus, while being careful and strategic, given our present circumstance. We have been closely monitoring the situation over the past few weeks here at Daybreak. I have spent considerable time this week connecting with other churches around the country and ultimately developing an action plan with our leadership team for how we will continue to spread the gospel of Jesus, while taking the necessary precautions to keep our congregation safe. We know that God is in control of all things and that he will continue to guide and lead us through this challenging season.

For several years we have been live streaming our services on Facebook each Sunday. This has given us the opportunity to reach those who can’t make it to the Daybreak campus, miss a service, or are just checking us out. Until a few days ago, we had no idea how important this small aspect of our ministry would become.

Sunday Services Will Be Online This Weekend
This Sunday, March 15th, our services will be held entirely online. Services will begin at 8:30 a.m. and you can visit our website anytime after that to participate. Our hope is to be able to gather together again on our church campus as soon as possible, but in the meantime, we believe we can continue to learn and grow as a church by worshipping and watching church together in our homes with friends and family. You can still invite your friends to watch with you by sharing it on your feed or texting them a link so they can join in!

To watch the livestream, click here to visit our website.

We will gather in this online format with worship and Bible teaching for as long as necessary until we receive guidance otherwise from the appropriate authorities.

Families with Kids
If you have kids that have been checked into the Daybreak Kids ministry in the last few month, you will be receiving communication from your Children’s Pastors. They will be sharing some activities to do with your kids this weekend, since we won’t be together on Sunday.

Mix Middle & High School - Our youth ministry, Mix United, will be streaming videos online over the next few weeks in lieu of services. More information will be sent out from the Youth Pastors in the next few days.

Tithes and Offering - Even though we’re not gathering in-person for church, you still have the opportunity to worship the Lord and make a difference in the lives of others by giving your tithes and offerings through our secure online giving page. To do so you can [click here](http://daybreakchurch.org/give/).

Other Ministries - Small groups, classes and other smaller gatherings will continue to occur on a case by case basis. If you are unsure or have concerns about any of our smaller gatherings, you can connect directly with the specific leaders. In the meantime, we will be providing alternate ways for you to grow closer to God and learn more about Him.

Here are some of the basic measures listed on the CDC website:

* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.

We will provide necessary updates to you via email and post them on social media as well as our website at www.daybreakchurch.org. Would you please take some time to be prayerful for our world and our community, specifically for those who are directly impacted by this virus.

Final Thoughts - Even though our world has changed, the power of God has not changed. The truth of Scripture has not changed. The hope of Jesus has not changed. Our mission as a church has not changed. Let us not give in to fear. Rather, let’s fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.

God Bless, 
Pastor Jason
