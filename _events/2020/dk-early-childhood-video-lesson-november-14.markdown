Last week we learned how Moses was man who was shown a lot of love when he was a baby, and grew up to save God's people. This week, we learn about some very special rules God gave Moses for his people. Moses walked all the way up a really giant mountain and God gave him the 10 Commandments. Watch our video lesson and print out the activity to help your whole family learn and remember that we show God we love him when we follow his rules.

Reminder: When you bring your EC kiddos to service this weekend, they will get to sit with you, worship with you and enjoy a fun DK activity bag.
