Happy Easter from Pastor Nicola and Slider! God is our Lord and Savior! He sent his son take all of our sins for us. Jesus died on a cross because some mean people didn't believe he was God's son but after he died something amazing happened! After three days of being inside a tomb, Jesus came back to life just like he said would. Jesus is alive!

We have been so blessed by being able to share these sweet videos all about who God is each week during this COVID season. Please join us in the coming weeks in our classrooms for fellowship with others and to learn more about Jesus!
