Pastor Nicola and Slider have been walking us through a really important series all about prayer and how we can talk to God. We can talk to God about anything, anywhere and anytime because He is always listening! Philippians tells us we should always talk to God. No matter what, tell God about everything! **Make sure you take the time to do the lesson craft this week.** It is the perfect way to incorporate prayer into your daily life as an entire family.
