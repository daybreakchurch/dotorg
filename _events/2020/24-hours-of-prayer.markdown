Join us as we spend 24 Hours in Prayer for our Spark Vision Campaign. As a congregation we will seek God for wisdom as we spark a movement of future pastors, missionaries and world-changers; creating a clear pathway for our kids to grow up into future leaders. We will have hourly shifts of people praying in the Upper Chapel on March 23 and 24. Sign up for one hour, or more.
