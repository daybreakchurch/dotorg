**Don't forget to join us tomorrow, Sunday 26th, for Daybreak's outdoor services 9a and 10a. First 150 kids (4yrs. and older) get a DK Summer Box!**

Guess what?! Miss Nicola and Slider have a brand new series to announce this week called "Dive In." We will explore what it means to follow Jesus. You will be a finder fish and find out that when you read the Bible and do what it says- tell others about Godâ€™s love and even follow others who love him too- you are following Jesus! Click on the lesson above to see how Jesus called a fisherman named Peter to be a fisher of men!
