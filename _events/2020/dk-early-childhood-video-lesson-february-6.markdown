“Hey God” is the title of our new series that starts this week! We are going to be learning all about prayer how we can go to God anytime anywhere! All you have to do is talk to God just like you talk to your friends and family. Did you know that when you do something wrong, God loves for you to tell Him about it and He will forgive you? Watch this weeks lesson video to learn with Pastor Nicola and Slider about the importance of forgiveness through prayer.

*“Do not worry about anything. But pray and ask God for everything you need. And when you pray, always give thanks." -Philippians 4:6 ICB*
