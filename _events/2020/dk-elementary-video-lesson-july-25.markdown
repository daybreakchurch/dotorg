There was a time, in the Old Testament scriptures, when they had laws about what they could eat or not eat and who they could talk to or not talk to. These were actual laws put into place so that everyone could know that God’s chosen people had special rules set aside for only them. But, when God sent Jesus to earth, he wanted everyone to know that those laws were not what the heart of God truly was about. He wants everyone to follow Jesus no matter who they are or where they come from and he also took away the rules about what we can eat or not eat. Jesus told his disciples all about this before he went back to heaven from earth but it seemed that many people who loved God still didn’t understand. This week, we will see how a man named Cornelius had a dream to let a stranger, named Peter, into his home. Peter also had a vision reminding him that everyone needed to understand that Jesus came to change some of the old rules and that he needed to travel to find Cornelius and tell everyone in that town about Jesus. Both men did what God had asked of them and because of Cornelius’ kindness toward Peter, many lives were changed.
