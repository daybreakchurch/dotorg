VROOM on over and join Mechanic Carl and Sparky fuel up with a story from Gods word, the Bible. We will learn that Moses was man who was shown a lot of love when he was a baby when he was saved from a mean king. When he was all grown up, the mean king did not like that Moses loved God and was very mean to all of Moses’ people until one day, with God’s help, Moses got the mean king to let his people leave. God rescued them from the mean king, split the sea and gave them water and food so they always knew that God loved them. God’s love never ends and we can show his love to everyone around us so that they can also know that love will never end.

Due to weather, Daybreak Church will be meeting online. See you all next week!
