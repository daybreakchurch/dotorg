As we continue to walk through the story of Jesus' birth, we finally get to hear about the day he was born! Jesus is God's greatest gift and it all started in a town called Bethlehem. Mary and Joseph had to travel for almost a week to their hometown and she was about to have a baby! When it was time to have the baby, they had nowhere to stay. The only place they found was with the animals a stable and this is where the King of World was born. It must have been so difficult for Mary to have her tiny baby in such a dirty and stinky place but God loved us so much that he gave us a Savior through His very own Son who would grow up in a humble home just like us and change the hearts of people forever.

*â€œWhile they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and place him in a manger, because there was no cures room available for them." Luke 2: 6-7*
