Last weekend we learned about Manna and how God provided for his people. This week Moses sent Joshua and Caleb, two strong and brave men who loved God into the promised land that God had planned out for them. Watch our video lesson to see what they find and how God guides his people into their new land. You will learn that God had a plan for his people way back when and still has a plan for your life today!

Reminder: When you bring your EC kiddos to service this weekend, they will get to sit with you, worship with you and enjoy a fun DK activity bag.
