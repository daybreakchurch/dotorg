Last week we learned how to have quiet time with the Lord. As we continue to learn how to be quiet with him, we will also learn about how we can read God’s Word through the account of the Ethiopian man who didn’t understand what he was reading in the Bible. One of Jesus’ friends named Philip asked if he wanted to know more. The man was happy that Philip came and was able to learn about who Jesus is and that God's Word is true. His relationship with God grew as he continued to read God’s Word.
