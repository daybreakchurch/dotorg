This week we get to hear about the revelation that Jesus gave John, His longest living disciple, while he was on the Island of Patmos. He was told to write down everything he saw and in this revelation he was given an amazing view of what Heaven will be like. Heaven is an amazingly beautiful place filled with light. This is not light from the sun but from God's glory! There is no more sin, death, sadness or pain and there is room for everyone who believes in Him. We will get to be with and praise Him for eternity! Sometimes in our lives, when we get weary and worry we can remember the one thing we know for sure is that, in the end, God will make all things right for those who trust him!

**We have no attachments because we are inviting you to come to Daybreak Church this Sunday for your very own children's programming (1st-5th grade) in the amphitheater! We have room for 35 kids each service, so come ready with some sunscreen and hats in the 80 degree weather!**

*"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." Revelation 21:4*
