Fear can be a strong feeling that can seem to stop you in your tracks even when we know it is part of Godâ€™s plan. This week we learn that there was a man named Ananias who was told by the Lord in a vision to go to the house that the blinded Saul was staying in and restore his sight. Ananias was fearful because he knew exactly what Saul had been doing to anyone who believed Jesus was the son of God and was worried Saul would hate him as well. He went because in that vision, the Lord told him that Saul was supposed to go and teach many people about Jesus and be a great man of God. Watch the lesson to find out what happened when Jesus helped Ananias face his fears and heal Saul!
