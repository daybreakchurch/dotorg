We have been learning so much in our current series "Super Fan". Did you know that Ruth was a distant grandmother of Jesus? How amazing is that?! We will continue to learn about kindness this weekend when we learn about what Jesus taught his disciples about going the extra mile. During this time, the Romans could ask anyone to carry all of their military gear for one mile and that person had a legal obligation to follow what they said. Jesus wanted his disciples to understand how to be kinder than they had to be and asked them to offer the Romans two miles instead of one. Being kind is not always easy if we have a bad day or are simply grumpy but what if we did what Jesus asked us and did more than we have to do for the people around us. Kindness is treating others the way we want to be treated and everyone wants to be treated with such love.

*"Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience." -Col. 3:12 NIV*
