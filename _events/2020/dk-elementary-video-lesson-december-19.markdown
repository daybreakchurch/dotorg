Last week, we learned that God loves us so much he sent a savior. This week we are reminded, in Luke 2:8-12, that God’s peace is for everyone. Shepherds were watching their sheep at night and an angel came to them, just like he had to Mary, and told them of the promised Messiah being born. The heavens opened and these shepherds got a glimpse of the angels and heavenly hosts praising God and saying “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”. Did you catch that? Peace is available for everyone who follows God! What an amazing promise we are given and an amazing gift God gave us through His son Jesus.

*“Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a great sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." Luke 2: 11-12*
