It's Birthday Club Sunday! Come join us in the Amphitheater this weekend and if your birthday is in November you get a crown and a special cookie!

When you watch a movie, it is easy to tell who is the hero and who is the villain because of what they say and do. In our series, we are learning about Integrity: choosing to be truthful in whatever you say and do. When we are truthful, people can trust us when we 'take off our mask' to show the real us. Our video lesson this week tells us about a man in the Bible named Gehazi, who told some lies that made him look like a bad man or 'villain." It is really hard to trust someone who lies to us and it makes it a lot more difficult to truly 'take off your mask' and show everyone who you really are. Sometimes even one small lie will make you look different to everyone around you because they don't know if they can trust what you say anymore. Watch this week's video lesson to find out how to be the good guy because when you are not truthful, you lose trust.

*“But God is faithful and fair. If we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins. He will forgive every wrong thing we have done. He will make us pure.” 1 John 1:9*
