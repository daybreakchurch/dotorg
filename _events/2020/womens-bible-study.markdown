Develop a New Understanding of How God Sees You.

Christine Caine is passionate about seeing every woman equipped to live her life on mission for Jesus. In this 7-session study, you’ll develop a new understanding of how God sees you and has chosen you to help make Jesus’ name known on this planet. Through biblical teaching and lessons from her own life, Christine will challenge you to share the story of how God’s love has transformed your life right where you are.

You can choose to attend the morning group from 9:00-11:00a or the evening one from 6:30-8:30p; both are on Thursdays at Daybreak. Cost is $20; payment is required with registration.

Childcare is available for ages birth thru Pre-K (morning) and ages 2-10 (evening) for a small fee.

Save 25% on childcare when you select Bible Study plus Pre-paid childcare.
