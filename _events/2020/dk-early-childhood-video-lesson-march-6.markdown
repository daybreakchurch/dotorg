In our last series we learned that we can pray to God! We can pray anytime, anywhere, and that He always hears our prayers. This week we are going to start a new series and will learn that God is our Lord! He is so powerful. There is no one more powerful in the entire universe than our God! God wants us to be kind to others because He is kind to you! How can you be kind this week?

*"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." -Ephesians 4:32*
