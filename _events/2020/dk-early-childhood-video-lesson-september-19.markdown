Exciting update on Daybreak Kids! All Early Childhood classrooms from the nursery to the Lego room will be open this Sunday September 20th for all who attend the outdoor services. We have taken many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos. We will be taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and all adults will be wearing masks the entire service. We can't wait to see you soon! 

For everyone who watches from home, this week we will be starting a brand new series called "Vroom." Slider and Pastor Nicola will help you learn about how to wait with a patient heart just like how Slider had to learn when he wasn't patient and ate a cookie before he was supposed to. We will be hearing about the story of Abraham's great adventure to an unknown land, where he learns to wait and be patient.
