##### BECOMING A STEPHEN MINISTER - Join our Team!

Join us for an informational meeting on **February 21, 2021 at 12:00pm **on Zoom, that will offer a comprehensive overview of our Care Ministry. Register [HERE](https://daybreak.churchcenter.com/registrations/events/696088) 

For those of you who want to come alongside and support others in a more intentional way, we provide in-depth training to become Care Ministers. 

##### WHAT IS THE CARE MINISTRY?

We all go through tough times in life that can be unsettling.  In the midst of these challenging seasons, it can be extremely helpful to have someone come alongside us to give understanding and encouragement – to provide stability, hope and Biblical principles to help us through the storm.

That is what a Care Minister is able to provide:  a listening ear, a supportive perspective, and God’s Word to help us through the challenges of life.

##### WHO ARE CARE MINISTERS?

At Daybreak, we have compassionate individuals who are trained to help us when we encounter loss, grief, relationship challenges, and a myriad of things that can throw our lives into a tailspin.  They are not professional counselors; they simply provide confidential care, love and support when we need it most.  A Care Minister is a caring individual who can help us navigate our present situation.

Perhaps you, a friend, or a family member would benefit from this kind of help and support.  If so, a Care Minister may be just what is needed.
