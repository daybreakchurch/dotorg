This week we are learning how to focus on what is true. In Philippians 4:8 we read to think on these things. That is something you can do every day. We can make the wise choice. We should choose to think, ON PURPOSE, about what’s true and what’s good. We should choose to pay attention to what God is doing in our life- in the good times and the bad times. 

*Philippians 4:8 "Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things."*
