We can find many answers to questions we have in the Bible. Do you have your Bible with you now? We can get answers when we talk to God and through His word. Did you know that it doesn't matter where we are when we talk to God? He can hear us no matter what! God wants us to talk to Him anytime, from anywhere. God is so good, and He sees all the good things we do for others.

*â€œThe Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth." -Psalm 145:18 NIV*
