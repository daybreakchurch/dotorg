This class offers a conversational environment where people can explore faith and experience community. Itâ€™s an ideal setting if you have questions, where your opinions and beliefs will be valued. If you are reconnecting with God after being away from church for a while or are not sure about God and the Bible, this is a safe place to discuss spiritual issues. Additionally, Starting Point is the best, first step if you have recently begun a relationship with God.

Classes will meet on Sunday mornings at the 10:00a service for 8 weeks beginning February 2. Space is limited. There is no fee for this class. For more information contact Len at 510 915 8753.
