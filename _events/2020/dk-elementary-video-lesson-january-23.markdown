We continue our "Rules for Life" series about responsibility this weekend. Remember that responsibility is showing you can be trusted with what is expected of you. Last weekend, we learned that the most important commandments to God are to love him first and love people next. If you notice, neither one of those options involves us loving ourselves and our stuff. Also, responsibility is not simply doing the right thing by keeping our 'stuff' nice or completing chores the right way. When we love God, we will take the 'stuff' we have and will be responsible by truly being generous with what we have been given. Through this generosity, we can show others we love them. This week's lesson video is about the parable of the rich man and the importance of being generous.

*â€œThen he said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions." Luke 12:15*
