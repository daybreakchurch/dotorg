We started our new series call "Super Fan!" this past weekend. We talked about what it means to be a fan of something and how if we are truly fans of God and follow him as intently as we do our sports teams, people will know about God because of who we are and how we are kind. This weekend we will learn about how to be kind to our family and friends through the book of Ruth. Ruth was kind to Naomi when she decided to stay with her and in return, Ruth was taken care of by Boaz when he married her. Did you know Ruth actually ended up being part of Jesus' family tree? How can you be kind to your family and friends this week?

*"You are God's chosen people. You ar hold and dearly loved. So put on tender mercy and kindness as if they were your clothes. Don't be proud. Be gentle and patient." 
-Colossians 3:12 NIrV*
