#### Isolated but not alone

Genesis 2:4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. 5 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, 6 but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 7 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. 
15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 
18 The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” We should never be embarrassed of feeling lonely because God designed us to need community. 

Psalm 68:6a God sets the lonely in families

##### We should establish rhythms so we can count on regular times of connection.

Hebrews 10:23 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. 24And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, 25not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

##### When we reach out it cures two people of loneliness at the same time.

Galatians 6:9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 10Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

Assignment:
Who are the people in my life the most likely to be feeling lonely right now? Who is one person I’m not close too that might suffer from loneliness? What is the best way to reach out and encourage them today?
