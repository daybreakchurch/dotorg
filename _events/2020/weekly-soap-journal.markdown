##### How to Journal

You will need a Bible, journal or piece of paper and a pen or pencil.

**S: SCRIPTURE**

Lookup the dayâ€™s reading in your Bible. Pray and ask God to highlight a verse to you as you read through the passage. When you are done, take the verse that God impressed on you and write it in your journal.

**O: OBSERVATION**

What do you think God is saying to you in this scripture? Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you and reveal Jesus to you. Paraphrase and write this scripture down in your own words.

**A: APPLICATION**

Personalize what you have read, by asking yourself how it applies to your life right now. Perhaps it is instruction, encouragement, revelation of a new promise or correction for a particular area of your life. Write how this Scripture can apply to you today.

**P: PRAYER**

This can be as simple as asking God to help you use this scripture, or it may be a greater insight on what He may be revealing to you. Remember, prayer is a two-way conversation, so be sure to listen to what God has to say. Now, write it out.
