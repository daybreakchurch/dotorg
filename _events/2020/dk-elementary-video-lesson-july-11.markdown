Saul was a man who thought he knew what was true. He thought that the people who believed in Jesus were wrong and made sure they would be punished, but he was in for a big shock! Jesus knew Saul would be a great person to spread His good news to everyone and knew something BIG would have to happen to change him. So, through an encounter with Jesus’ light, Saul was blinded and soon realized that doing what was true meant believing in and following God’s son. His heart was changed, he could see again and through his life we can learn that knowing Jesus changes the way you see everything!
