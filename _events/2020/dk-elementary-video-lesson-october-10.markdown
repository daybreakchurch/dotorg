As we continue in our series called "Block Party," we will open our Bibles (1 Samuel 20) and learn all about the important friendship David and Jonathan had. Jonathan was royalty and David was a shepherd boy but he had just defeated Goliath! David found favor in the eyes of his new friend but Jonathanâ€™s father, King Saul did not like David and even tried to kill him. This friendship was a true example of a friendship filled with love for one another. They vowed to be friends no matter what! This week we will learn how to love our friends best.

*"And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father." 1 Samuel 19:4a*
