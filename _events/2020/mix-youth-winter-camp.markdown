Mix Youth Winter Camp at Forest Home is an experience designed to challenge, encourage, and engage students in 6th-12th grade. It will be an EPIC weekend with zip-lining through the trees, careening down the tube run, playing games in a cozy lodge, and climbing the Sky Trail. You are bound to make memories that will last a lifetime!

The cost for the weekend is $269 which includes transportation and food. A $50 non-refundable deposit is required with registration. Space is available on a first-come, first-serve basis so don't wait!
