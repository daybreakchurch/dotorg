Happy New Year! There is so much to look forward to in a new year and so much that God wants to do in and through us. We've learned that God created us with creativity in mind. Remember, creativity is imagining what you could do because you're made in God's image. Join Daybreak Kids Elementary as we take a look at a gal named Esther and see how she used her creativity to save not only her family but a whole group of people.

*â€œFor if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this." Esther 4:14*
