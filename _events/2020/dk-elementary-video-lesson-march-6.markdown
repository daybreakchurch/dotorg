Last weekend we got to hear from a super cool couple who started a business that would teach and help the people of Haiti take care of their own families. They learn to build ovens, make and bake the bread that will sustain them. What a great way to help the people! This weekend we are starting a brand new series called "Super Fan!". We will be learning all about how and why God calls us to be kind. This weekend we learn the simple truth of being kind because God was kind to us.

*"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." -Ephesians 4:32*

Remember check in begins **15 minutes prior** to each service time.
