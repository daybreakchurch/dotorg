This week we will learn more about how to be quiet with God. We will hear about a time when Jesus taught people how to pray. He wanted everyone to know that a prayer does not have to be big or fancy with just the right words. He taught them "The Lord's Prayer" and that God truly wants us to open our hearts to him and he will hear our prayers. Jesus spent many precious hours with God and we can too!

*"This, then, is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven." -Matthew 6:9-10*
