Slider and Pastor Nicola will help you learn about how to have quiet time with God through worship. In the book of Psalms we can read some special songs and poems David wrote to God because he loved God so much! When we love God, we can sing to him too! Watch this week's video lesson and take some time to tell God how good He is by singing a worship song with Ranger Rocky!
