Join us for our **Fall Lovely Night** on our Daybreak campus!  

Lovely ladies, we have a special night just for you!  As we head into the fall, letâ€™s come together for a night of worship, inspiring message and a delicious dessert/coffee bar.  We will be meeting outdoors at Daybreak where we can have room to spread out. So, bring your lawn chair, your mask, a cozy blanket and an open heart ready to hear a powerful Word! 

**Thursday, October 15th at 6:00pm**

If you have questions, please email lovely@daybreakchurch.org
