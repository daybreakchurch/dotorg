If you haven't already heard, all Early Childhood classrooms, from the nursery to the Lego room, are now open Sunday mornings. We have taken many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos as well as the classroom numbers are limited on a first come first served basis. We will be taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and all adults will be wearing masks the entire service. We can't wait to see you!

This week in "Vroom", we will learn about how to be happy with what we have. Yesterday, Slider was playing with his friend but wanted the ball his friend was playing with and he took it! This was not very nice, but his friend did what God would want us to do and showed kindness. In Genesis 13 we can read about a time when God spoke to Abraham and Lot who wanted land that was someone else's and wouldn't stop arguing. Watch this week's video lesson to learn that God wants us to have a heart that is glad with what he has given us.
