In our "Block Party" series, we learn that friendship is using your words and actions to show others you care. Everyone is invited to be Jesus' friend. In our last week, we learn from the book of John about the time when one of Jesus' disciples, Peter, did something that probably hurt Jesus' feelings very badly. Jesus could have been so angry and decided to no longer be a friend to Peter but instead, after he died and rose from the grave, when he found his friends fishing, he invited them to have breakfast with him. They cooked the fish they had caught and enjoyed some time together but Peter seemed extremely upset. He was worried Jesus hadn't forgiven him for what he done but Jesus is a good friend and forgave Peter that day. He forgives us today as well. We can learn that friends forgive each other even if they mess up and hurt our feelings because Jesus first forgave us.

**Next Friday, October 30th at 6pm we will be having our very own worship experience in the amphitheater. Come sing some songs and learn what worship is. We will have some fun, social distance, Glow in the Dark games, candy and more! Feel free to come dressed up (not scary) and warm since we will be outside. Check in starts at 5:45p. We can't wait to see you!**
