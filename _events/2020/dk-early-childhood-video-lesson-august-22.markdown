We are starting a brand new series, "The Great Outdoors," all about how we can know God in deeper ways. This week, take the pledge to be kind, be safe and grow with God! You will join Slider, Pastor Nicola and Ranger Rocky as they learn that one great way to know God deeper is by spending quiet time with him just like Jesus did. We even added a really awesome craft for you to create for your bedroom to let everyone know you are spending some special quiet time with God.
