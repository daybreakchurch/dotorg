God’s Word is sweeter than any treat we could ever have. As you enjoy your mug treat spend time reading the Bible or go through our “Time with Jesus” post on Instagram (@daybreak.kids) as a family!

*"Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it." Proverbs 22:6*
