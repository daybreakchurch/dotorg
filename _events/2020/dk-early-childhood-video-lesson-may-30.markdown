This week as we watch our last video for the series, we get to learn about why last week's lesson of sharing God's love is so important. Like the woman who lost her precious coin in Jesus' parable and was so excited to find it again; God is always excited when his precious creation loves him and wants to be his friend. Keep sharing God's love with everyone and remember: God loves you and made you special!
