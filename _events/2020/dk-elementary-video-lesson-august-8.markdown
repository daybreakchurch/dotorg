Last week we learned that God loves us no matter what and offers grace to all who believe Jesus and want to live the way He says is best. We learned in the past about a man named Saul who did bad things but when he believed in Jesus, he started to tell everyone about who Jesus is. That same Saul was also called Paul and today we learn that he made his way to Athens to talk about Jesus but when he arrived, he found that they believed in many gods and questioned everything Paul had to say. He decided to use how they learned best to teach them all about how awesome God is and how His son, Jesus, rose from the dead. He created each person with a purpose and an adventure to live. He wants us all to seek Him and come to Him. Watch this weekâ€™s video lesson to see how Paul helped others know Jesus.

**We have no attachments this week because we are inviting you to come to Daybreak Church this Sunday for your very own children's programming in the amphitheater! We have room for 35 kids each service, so come early to the 9am or 10am service to get checked-in!**
