Hello Finder Fish! This week, you will get to learn a story from God's Word all about how Peter told the people around him that he didn’t know Jesus. He lied and told them he didn’t know Jesus three times but Jesus forgave Peter because he loves all of his friends. Jesus wants us to get to know Him and you can learn all about how when you watch this week's video lesson.
