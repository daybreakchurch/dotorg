Peter was a good friend of Jesus, but he did something that was not kind. He told people he didnâ€™t know Jesus and was not his friend at all. After he said this, he immediately felt so badly. When he went to Jesus to ask for forgiveness, guess what? Jesus forgave him right away. We learn this week all about the importance of friendship and asking forgiveness. Jesus teaches us that love is kind.

All Early Childhood classrooms, from the Nursery to the Lego room, are now open Sunday mornings! We have taken many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos as well as the classroom numbers are limited on a first come first served basis. We will be taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and all adults will be wearing masks the entire service. We can't wait to see you!
