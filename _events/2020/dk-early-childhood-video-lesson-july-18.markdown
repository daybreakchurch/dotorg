This week, as we continue learning about Paulâ€™s travels, we get to learn about when Paul traveled to Rome. While he was in Rome, he wrote many letters to churches from all over the area and also told everyone he saw about Jesus. His teachings about Jesus lasted from when the sun came up until the very next day. Many people came to believe and understand that everything Jesus said was true! Who can believe in Jesus? Everyone can believe in Jesus!
