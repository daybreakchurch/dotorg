Pastor Nicola and Slider are ending the series called VROOM...where we learned all about patience, forgiveness and love. We learned last week, that there were some angry men who put Paul in prison but that Paul wasn't angry, he was kind because Jesus taught him that love is kind. This week we will learn to do what is right. While Paul was in prison a guard did what was right and took care of Paul in a way that kept him safe. We can be kind, loving and do what is right for others as well because Jesus loved us first.

Classrooms open at 8:45 Sunday morning and take many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos. We are taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and adults are wearing masks the entire service. *We can't wait to see you!*

**Also, come to campus on Friday, October 30th at 6p for a church wide worship night. There will be kids programming for all ages!**
