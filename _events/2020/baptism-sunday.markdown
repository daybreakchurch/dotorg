Our next baptism is coming up on January 26 during the 8:30a, 10:00a and 11:30a services. If you are a follower of Jesus Christ and have not yet been baptized, we encourage you to take a step of obedience and be baptized.

IMPORTANT: If your elementary-aged child, between 3rd and 5th grade, would like to be baptized they will need to meet with Pastor Christa prior to being baptized. This class is required for all children to help prepare them for baptism. Pastor Christa will schedule a time to meet with your child. Children's inquiries can be directed to Christa Katona at christa@daybreakchurch.org .

If you have additional questions, please contact Pastor Laura at laura@daybreakchurch.org, or 760.931.7773 x15.
