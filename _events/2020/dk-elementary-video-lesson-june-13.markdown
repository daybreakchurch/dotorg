Today, we learn about a disciple named Stephen who was "a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6:5) and lived out his faith spreading the gospel until his life was ended. He listened quietly for the Holy Spirit's guidance with every step he took. In the same way, we can do this today through prayer and recognizing his still small voice to help us make the right choices. We can always keep going even when we don't know what is up ahead in life because God was here in the beginning and only He knows the end.
