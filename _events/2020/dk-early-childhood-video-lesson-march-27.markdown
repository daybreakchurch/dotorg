God is everything for us, because he is our Lord! He is always with us, He is our shepherd, ultimate defender and protector. God is so powerful! Pastor Nicola and Slider will introduce an amazing time when Jesus performed an incredible miracle and fed 5,000 people with only 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish. Today, we have food to eat, a warm house to live in and families who love us. God loves us very much and God is our provider!
