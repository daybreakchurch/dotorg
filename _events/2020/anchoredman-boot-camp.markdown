Are you ready to become the kind of guy that a woman, a family and most importantly, God can trust? This 5-week course will teach you four life-changing principles necessary to become the leader and protector God made you to be. Through the analogy of building a rock-climbing anchor, Pastor Jason will help you develop a realistic, step-by-step plan for staying anchored to God. Along the way, you’ll meet some other guys who are headed in the same direction. Regardless of your past, or how messed up you may think your life is now, it’s never too late to get your life on the right course. 

Classes will be held at Daybreak on Wednesday evenings from 6:30-8:00p beginning on September 23. There is a $25 fee for this class. Register soon as space is limited.
