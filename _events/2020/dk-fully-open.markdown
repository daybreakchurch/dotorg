Daybreak Kids is making every reasonable effort to ensure health and safety within our classrooms. There are specific health & safety protocols our team has strategically put into effect for daybreak KIDS.

Masks: All staff, volunteers, and children are required to wear a mask. Children 5 and under are not required to wear masks. 

Health Screening: This is a mandatory part of the check-in, please be patient with the process.

* We ask that you do not bring your child if anyone in your family has a fever. 
* Temperatures will be taken on-site with every staff member, volunteer, and child before they enter the space. Any person with a recorded temperature over 100 degrees will not be admitted. 
* We will also ask you at each visit, other health-related questions as you sign your child in.  The answers to these questions will determine whether or not your child may attend Children’s Ministry.
* There will be a socially distanced check-in. Masks and sanitizer provided at all check-in locations.

Social Distancing: 
Early Childhood (Birth-Kindergarten): Children are not required to social distance, but the environment will be set up to encourage social distancing. There will be no snack provided.

Elementary (1st-5th grade): Children are required to social distance. There will be no snack provided.
