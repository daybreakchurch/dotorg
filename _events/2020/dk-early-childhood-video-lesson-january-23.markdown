Ahoy Mateys, we are still learning about how awesome Jesus is! We learned, last week, about how Jesus performed many miracles and even fed 5,000 people with one boy's small lunch. This weekend, we will be reminded of how amazing it is that after Jesus died for us, rose from the dead and went back to heaven 40 days later, he left His Holy Spirit for us so we would never be alone! Wow! When we ask Jesus into our life and invite His Holy Spirit to fill our hearts, Jesus is always with us and wants to be our friend forever!

*â€œYou are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothes with power from on high." Luke 24: 48-49*
