We all make mistakes and sometimes we try to make up for them by being extra nice or working really hard to impress the person we upset and hope they know we are sorry. As Christians, it can be easy for us to think that if we make a mistake, God is angry and doesnâ€™t love us anymore but that simply is not true. God loves you exactly how you are, mistakes and all! There is absolutely nothing you could do that would make Him love you any more or any less. In fact, He wants you to be with Him so badly that He sent his son Jesus, as a gift for us, to show His grace and forgiveness. Grace is a gift that is freely given and Jesus is a gift for everyone.
