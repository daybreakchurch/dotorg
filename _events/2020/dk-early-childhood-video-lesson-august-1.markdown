As we continue to Dive In with Slider and Pastor Nicola as ‘finder fish’, helping Sandy Shark on his adventure to show his friend how to trust Jesus, we will learn about a time when Jesus walked on water to help his friends in a storm. Jesus wasn’t the only person who walked on water that day. Watch this week’s lesson to find out which disciple had enough faith to follow Jesus out on the stormy seas and learned to trust him no matter what.
