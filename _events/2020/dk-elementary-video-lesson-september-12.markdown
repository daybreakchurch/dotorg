God created all of us on purpose and for a purpose. Through the Book of Esther we get to see how God's purpose for a humble Jewish girl named Esther was bigger than she had ever thought. She actually became queen and saved her people! We might not save a nation, but because we were made for a purpose by the Creator, our lives matter and we can choose to use our gifts and creativity to point people towards Jesus.

*"For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." -Ephesians 2:10*
