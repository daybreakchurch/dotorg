Please join us for a Social Distancing Lovely Beach Bonfire! 

This will be a super casual evening at the beach- where we will be able to spread out, yet still be able to see each other, hang out and catch up with our Lovely Community! Simply stop by for a little bit or stay as long as you want!

Bring your beach chair and a blanket- S'mores will be provided!  Bring a neighbor or friend, too!

When:  Thursday, September 17 @ 7pm
Where: Ponto Beach - meet by Tower 20
(there is parking on the street or in the parking lot)
No RSVP necessary
