We have been learning how to show we are Super Fans of God through our kindness to everyone around us. This weekend we will be learning about the importance of being kind to those who are different than us. In the book of Luke, we read about a conversation between Jesus and a man known as an expert of the law. He understood that it is very important to love God and love his neighbors as himself but he wanted Jesus to tell him exactly what he meant by a neighbor. Jesus replied with a parable that many of us have heard, about the Good Samaritan who helped a man who was very different from him even though society at the time saw the man as an outcast. Jesus teaches us that every single person deserves kindness, even when they are different we disagree because we should be loving our neighbor as we love ourselves.

*"He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’"-Luke 10:27*
