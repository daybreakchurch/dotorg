Grab your Summer Box and get out the M&Ms, Oreos, beach ball, and sidewalk chalk. Join Mr. Nick and Mr. Adam in some CHAOS games and don't forget to bring a smile on your neighbors' faces this week with some sidewalk chalk art as well as encouraging notes/verses.

*"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord."-Psalm 150:6*
