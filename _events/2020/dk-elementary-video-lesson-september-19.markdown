God created all of us on purpose and for a purpose. Last weekend we learned how Esther got to see God's purpose for her life in a big way but sometimes it might not seem like our life will make an impact in history. This week we'll learn about four friends who had so much faith that they carried their paralyzed friend all the way to Jesus so that he could be healed. In our message video, we will see that even the most simple acts of faith can have a big impact.

**We are also celebrating September birthdays- Happy Birthday!**
