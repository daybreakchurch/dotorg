**DivorceCare: Surviving the Holidays**

Wondering how you will survive the weeks surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas? Are you dreading these holidays, knowing that everything has changed and that happy memories from past years can’t be recreated?

Our Surviving the Holidays seminar is especially for people who are separated and divorced. 
You’ll learn:

•	Helpful tips for surviving social events
•	Ways to give your kids a good holiday experience
•	How to discover hope for your future

Join us for a free, 2-hour seminar on November 10, beginning at 6:30 pm at Daybreak Church in the “Breakfast Club” (located on the first floor just to the left of the main stairway leading to the Offices. Park in the lower parking lot.)  
We encourage you to invite others you know who could benefit from this seminar.
