God made us so that we think and act a little like him. We are made in his image! In Ephesians, we can learn that we are God's workmanship. He created us so we can be creative! This week we will talk about why creativity is important and that there are many different ways to show our gifts and talents. God created us for a specific purpose and we are all created with unique characteristics to carry out His love for others. Also, this week, we are having service INDOORS! We are so excited to be able to celebrate our creativity and enjoy some A/C. We have room for 40 kids indoors and will continue to be physically distanced with masks, temp checks and sanitizer!

*"For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." -Ephesians 2:10*
