There was a mean king who ruled God’s people and even wanted to get rid of all of the baby boys because he didn’t want them to grow up and love God. One day, a special mama was given a message from God to save her baby and put him in a basket in the river. When that baby was floating, the mean king’s daughter found him and just knew she could love and take care of him. The king’s daughter showed this baby extra love when she let his mama feed him while he was tiny. To find out who this baby was, watch our video lesson and learn how you can always show love to the people around you!

Classrooms open at 8:45a Sunday morning and take many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos. We are taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and adults are wearing masks the entire service. *We can't wait to see you!*
