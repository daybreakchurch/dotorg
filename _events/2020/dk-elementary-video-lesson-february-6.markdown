We are in week 4 of our series called “Rules for Life” and we will be looking at Matthew 25:14-30 where Jesus teaches the "Parable of the Talents." It is important to be wise with what we are given. When Jesus went back to heaven, he left us with a big responsibility to take care of his flock left here on earth. Not only are we given talents that we can share with others, we are also being trusted to love and take care of his people.

"His master replied, 'well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'" -*Matthew 25:23*
