In our last week of the "I Spy" series we will learn about how Peter did exactly what Jesus told him to do. He went and told all kinds of different people the good news about Jesus. Jesus wants to be friends with every single person no matter where they live, what language they speak, what they look like or what they have done. When Peter told people about Jesus, they believed and became Jesus' forever friend! Everyone can believe in Jesus!
