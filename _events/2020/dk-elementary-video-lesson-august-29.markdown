We just finished up last week with learning about Heaven and how amazing it will be when we all get to be there with God forever. This week we will start from the very beginning in Genesis when God created everything! There is no limit to God's creativity and when he made us it got personal. God made us so that we think and act a little like him. We are made in his image! When we take a close look at ourselves we can see that we have imagination behind our eyes, we have hands that can help others lift heavy things, our feet take us to those in need and our hearts are filled with love for others. Take a look at all of God's creation this week. As you plant and water and take care of your seed, imagine the detail it took to create something so beautiful but to him you are his favorite!

**We have no attachments because we are inviting you to come to Daybreak Church this Sunday for your very own children's programming (1st-5th grade) in the amphitheater! We have room for 35 kids each service, so come ready with some sunscreen and hats in the 80 degree weather!**

*"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." Genesis 1:27*
