This week is Birthday Club and Slider can’t wait to sing Happy Birthday to everyone who has October birthdays! During our lesson time, Pastor Nicola wants to teach you about a time when she was angry at Slider’s choices but then she remembered a part of the Bible when Paul made some people really angry when he talked about all the amazing things Jesus did for his friends. The angry people put him in jail but Paul kept teaching that Jesus loves everyone and love is not angry! We can all learn how to be kind and chose to forgive our friends just like Jesus, instead of being angry.

All Classrooms are now open Sunday mornings! We take many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos. Classroom numbers are limited. We will be taking the temp of everyone in the classroom, adults will be wearing masks the entire service and we disinfect the room between services. We can't wait to see you!
