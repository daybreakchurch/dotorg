Last weekend we learned about Esther and how she used her creativity to save not only her family but a whole group of people. This week we will learn about the importance of living a life the way Jesus wants us to live, no matter our age. Sometimes it's easy to think that kids can't do anything big but that is not correct. Just like God had Esther, a young girl, fulfill big things, He has a plan for every single one of us. Even though you may be young, you can do so much for the kingdom in your every day life.

*â€œDon't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity." 1 Timothy 4:12*
