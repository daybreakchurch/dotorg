We hope you are all enjoying some time celebrating the love you have for your friends and family on this long weekend. Week 5 in our series is all about using our words wisely and how our words can actually do the opposite of show love for our friends. God wants us to be responsible with more than just the things he has blessed us with but also with our words as well. **We are so excited we get to share this important lesson with you this weekend indoors!** Skip right past the Amphitheater and come on over to the colorful Polka Dots in front of the Student Center to check in beginning 15 minutes prior to each service time.
