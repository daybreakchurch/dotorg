We continue our "Rules for Life" series about responsibility this weekend. Remember that responsibility is showing you can be trusted with what is expected of you. We have learned God's most important commandments and about generosity. This weekend we are going to learn about the importance about hard work through the parable of the Ant and Sluggard in Proverbs 6. Ants are the tiniest creatures but strong. They were created to work! They persevere through destruction and work hard to build their homes. Sometimes hard work isn't fun but it is not something to be upset about because God created us to work!

*â€œGo to the ant, O Sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise." Proverbs 6:6*
