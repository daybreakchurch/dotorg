We are starting a new series this weekend called "Rules for Life". We will be learning about responsibility. This is showing you can be trusted with what is expected of you. Our first week we will be learning about what Jesus says is the greatest commandment of all. He teaches us all how to love God, and love others. Watch this week's lesson video and practice responsibility in your own home and those who you see everyday.

*â€œDon't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity." 1 Timothy 4:12*
