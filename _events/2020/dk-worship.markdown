We are so thrilled to share with you an opportunity for your child(ren) to participate in! All kids in 1st-5th grade will be performing on the main worship center stage at all services on Sunday, March 29. We already introduced and have been practicing the "Ask, Seek, Knock;" it was a hit! This Sunday, March 1st, we will be introducing the second song. As we continue practicing, we would love for you to join your child in learning and worshiping together during the week! Below are two YouTube Links that will take you to each song the kids will be performing. 

["Good, Good Father"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C_QF24u2I) 

["Ask, Seek, Knock"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3vXskhI1ig&list=RDJ3vXskhI1ig&start_radio=1) 

There will also be one rehearsal on Thursday, March 26 from 4:15p-5:30p. Special performance t-shirts will be distributed during this time. We are so excited for your child to join us and look forward to seeing the continued "Spark" of passion for God ignited in Daybreak Kids. Please feel free to email christa@daybreakchurch.org with any questions. Are you Sunday!
