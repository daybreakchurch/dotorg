We will be celebrating the sacrifice Christ made for us with an online service. Tune in to either Facebook or Youtube at either 6:00 or 8:00p. We'll be taking communion, so grab some wine/grape juice and crackers/bread. 

*Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.*
