Today, we continue our series called "VROOM" but first, we want to announce that Slider is practicing being kind and generous and he asked Pastor Nicola and her friends to give every kid who comes to church on Sunday morning, their very own special race car. Wow! Thank You Slider! This week we will hear about a time when Jesus was praying in the garden but when some people came to arrest him, one of his friends, named Peter tried to protect Jesus and cut the ear off of one of the guards! Jesus did something really amazing after that. Watch this week's video lesson to see the good ending of this story and how Jesus taught Peter how to be kind.

REMINDER: If you haven't already heard, all Early Childhood classrooms, from the nursery to the Lego room, are now open Sunday mornings. We have taken many precautionary measures for the safety of your kiddos as well as the classroom numbers are limited on a first come first served basis. We will be taking the temp of everyone in the classroom and all adults will be wearing masks the entire service. We can't wait to see you!
