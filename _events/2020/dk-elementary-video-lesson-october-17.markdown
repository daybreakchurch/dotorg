This week we will learn that God sent people called prophets to speak his words. In 1 Kings 19, Elijah was sent to speak what God wanted his people to know. While Elijah was on the mountain of Horah, God told him to anoint Elisha as the next prophet. Elijah threw his cloak on Elisha as a symbol that he was to be next in line. Elisha said goodbye to his family before he set out on the road to go with Elijah. He grew and learned everything he needed to know through the encouragement of Elijah and was a great prophet of the Lord. Friends encourage one another and we can learn to be encouraging to everyone we meet.

*"Then he arose and went after Elijah andassisted him." 1 Kings 19*
