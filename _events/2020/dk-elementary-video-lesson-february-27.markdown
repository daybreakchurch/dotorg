Last weekend we were able to talk to a missionary who has a heart for Haiti and we even learned some fun words in Kreyol. We learned about how we can pray for them and brought home a sheet with prayer points for the kids in Haiti. This weekend, Daybreak Elementary will be introduced to a very special couple who also has a heart for families in Haiti and they created a way for the people in Haiti to learn, work and provide food for their families. Your kids will be making cards for the kids in Haiti letting them know they are cared about and being prayed for all the way from California. Please join us this week as we continue to learn about how we can help grown God's kingdom around the world. 

Remember to skip right past the Amphitheater and come on over to the colorful polka dots in front of the Student Center to check in beginning **15 minutes prior** to each service time.
