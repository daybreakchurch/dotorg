This is our last week of our "Indescribable" series where we are learning that God created all of us in his image and we are his handiwork. We have learned that we are creative because God is creative, we were made to work with others and God created all of us for a specific purpose. We are wrapping up this series with Jesus' instruction through his special sermon about how to be the light of the world to spread his love to everyone on earth.

*"In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." -Matthew 5:16*
