In our lesson this week, we get to learn more about how awesome Jesus is! Did you know he fed 5,000 people with only 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread? When Jesus prayed over the basket of food and blessed it, there was enough to feed every single person who was there listening to him teach. Our God is amazing! \

*â€œAnd they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children." Matthew 14:20-21*\
