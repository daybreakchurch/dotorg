### **Staying in Love**

**Falling in love is easy. But staying in love requires a plan.**

Join us for a 5-week study, *Staying in Love* by Andy Stanley. Is it possible for two people to fall in love and actually stay there? Absolutely! Let Andy show you how in this 5-week, video-based study with small group discussion.

The deadline to join this session of Marriage Enrichment has passed, and we will be offering the next classes in January 2021.
