### *Cherish: The One Word That Changes Everything for Your Marriage* 
Millions of couples getting married have pledged to “love and to cherish until death do us part.” Most of us understand the love part…but what does it mean to cherish our spouse? Learning to truly cherish each other turns marriage from an obligation into a delight. If you find yourself “going through the motions,” cherishing can breathe light, hope, and new life into a marriage – even one marred by neglect and disrespect.

Join us for a 6-week study at Daybreak Tuesday evenings (6:30-8:30p) beginning January 21. Cost is $30/couple; childcare is available for ages 2-10 for a small fee. For more information, contact Angie at 760 525 1327.
