Marriage should be a source of joy to both husband and wife, and a source of strength, confidence, and encouragement to all the members of the family. The design for marriage was formulated by God in the Garden of Eden...before sin came into the human race. God intended it to be an awe-inspiring, intimate, fruitful, joyous relationship - in short, life-giving!

This six-week study is designed to help us rediscover God's design for the Life-Giving Marriage.

Join us for a 6-week study beginning February 2 through March 9, from 7:00-8:30 p.m. We will be meeting online.
