Daybreak Ladies!

Join us March 6-7 on our campus for a very special weekend. Let’s discover together what it looks like to truly believe that our worth comes from the God of the universe who loves us and created us. He wants us to live knowing who He says we are in a world that tells us different.

This weekend will be all things “LOVELY”. Fun, food, friends, and a time of connecting with our heavenly Father!

Register now! The price will increase to $109 on February 17.
