Slider and Pastor Nicola have a special message for all June birthdays this week. We will continue with our "I Spy" series all about the awesome things we can spy that God did for us. We learn about how a man named Paul told everyone that God created the whole earth and everything in it. He also sent us Jesus to be our friend forever!

**We have no links this week. Enjoy your Father's Day and don't forget to give your craft gift you made to your dad!**

*"As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him." -Psalm 103:13*
