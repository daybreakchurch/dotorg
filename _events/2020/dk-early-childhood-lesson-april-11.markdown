### Happy Easter!
### He is Risen!

In this week's lesson, we will learn about the true meaning of Easter. Easter is more than new clothes and baskets of candy. It’s a time to pause, to help our children pause, and reflect on the meaning of Easter. Of the sacrificial love displayed on the cross—a love we can share with our families, and with others, too. Yes, we have chocolate bunnies, candy and egg hunts but  Easter is about the resurrection of our Lord and Savior and is something to be celebrated! 
 

Teach them about Jesus by talking about what a real Easter Bunny is

Use a rabbit picture, a stuffed bunny or even a real one (if you are adventurous) to teach some of the characteristics of Jesus that we should all try to have. By adding a Bible verse to each quality, you will create a true Easter Bunny.

Real Easter bunnies:

* are white as snow because Jesus takes all sin away (Isaiah 1:18b).
are gentle, kind-hearted and forgiving (Ephesians 4:32).
* have big ears that are quick to listen (James 1:19).
* have big eyes to look carefully and choose what is good (1 Thessalonians 5:21).
* have no voice for complaining or arguing (Philippians 2:13).
* are quiet in prayer, but hop with thanksgiving and rejoicing (Philippians 4:4-6).
* have big feet to go tell others about Jesus so they can be like Easter bunnies, too (Matthew 28: 19-20).
* eat what is healthy by filling up on God’s word every day (Psalm 119:11).
