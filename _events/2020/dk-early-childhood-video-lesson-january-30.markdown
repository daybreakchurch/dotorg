We are still learning about how awesome and powerful Jesus is! Even if you are afraid or lonely, all you need to do is pray and He will give you the power of the Holy Spirit to no longer be afraid. This week's lesson is about one of Jesus’ friends named John. John spent time on a beautiful island called Patmos. While he was there, an angel came to talk to him about what Heaven would be like. John was shown many things about Heaven. He learned that Heaven is so beautiful and that nobody is sad or hurting in Heaven. He even learned that Jesus is coming back soon and we can tell everyone we know all about it so that they will get to be in Heaven too. Jesus is always with us and wants to be our friend forever!

*“I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus." -Revelation 1:9*
