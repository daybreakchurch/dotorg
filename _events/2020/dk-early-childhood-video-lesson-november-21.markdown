Pastor Nicola and Slider continue to walk with us through the life of Moses. We have learned about how he was saved as a baby all the way to when he was an adult and given the 10 commandments. Today, we get to learn about the time God sent Manna, a special kind of bread, from the sky to feed the Israelites.

Reminder: When you bring your EC kiddos to service this weekend, they will get to sit with you, worship with you and enjoy a fun DK activity bag.
