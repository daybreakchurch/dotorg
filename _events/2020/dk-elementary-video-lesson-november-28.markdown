We are starting a brand new series all about Christmas! Christmas is celebrating Jesus, God’s greatest gift. This week we will learn about how the Israelites had gotten themselves in big trouble when they would turn from God. God always rescued them and He even promised to send a savior who would rescue them from all of their mistakes. In the book of Isaiah (over 700 years before Jesus was born) we read about God’s promise of this savior and in Luke, we can read all about when this promise had been fulfilled. It is amazing to learn that God makes promises and never breaks them! We can always have hope because God keeps his promises.

*Luke 2:11 " For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."*
