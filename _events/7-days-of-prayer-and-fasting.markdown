Throughout the Bible, we read of times where the people of God gathered to pray and fast for their nation and their land.  When times get difficult in our world, the best response is to take intentional time to pray and seek God’s intervention. God promises to hear our prayers when we seek Him!

###### “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” 2 Chronicles 7:14

On Sunday, Pastor Jason Graves challenged everyone at Daybreak to take some time each day this week to pray and fast for God to intervene in our society right now. We believe we are at a time where we as a community need to collectively ask our God to heal our land. Regardless of our individual political and philosophical perspectives, we can unite in asking God to bring an end to the pandemic, healing to the division that is tearing our nation apart and wisdom for the leadership God has placed throughout the various levels of authority across our nation.

Daily Prayer Topics Online - each day for a verse and prayer prompts to guide us as we pray together for God to heal our land! Below you will find information on what an intentional time of prayer and fasting can look like.
