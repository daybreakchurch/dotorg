###### Money and church can be a touchy issue - but it doesn't have to be.

We don't give because God needs our money, and we don't give because the church needs our money. It's much bigger than that. We give because God asked us to and following through shows that we trust Him.

At Daybreak there are multiples ways you can give to support your home church:

* Give online using the button below;
* Text any dollar amount to 84321;
* Using the offering envelopes during weekend services.
