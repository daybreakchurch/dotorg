Integrity is choosing to be truthful in whatever you say and do. This week we will find out, through Daniel and 3 of his friends, that we don’t have to be who others think we should be. We can follow God and know that He will be with us no matter what. Daniel and his friends did something very different from all of the other people under the care of the king. He stood up to them and said he would only what God created and was never offered to false gods first. God honored them and blessed them in ways that no one ever thought could be possible. Watch this weeks video lesson and learn how you can be truthful with your whole life." />

  <p>We are so excited to get started on our next, 4 week, series called “Offstage, Drop the Act” all about Integrity and taking the mask of who we think we should be off to reveal who God calls us to be even when no one else is around. Integrity is choosing to be truthful in whatever you say and do. This week we will find out, through Daniel and 3 of his friends, that we don’t have to be who others think we should be. We can follow God and know that He will be with us no matter what. Daniel and his friends did something very different from all of the other people under the care of the king. He stood up to them and said he would only what God created and was never offered to false gods first. God honored them and blessed them in ways that no one ever thought could be possible. Watch this weeks video lesson and learn how you can be truthful with your whole life.</p>

<p>Come each Sunday morning to guess and unmask who is behind the mask of the week: the panda, the wolf and more! We can’t wait to see you!</p>
