  <p>Have you ever had a week where nothing seemed to go right? Maybe you stub your toe, you break your favorite mug, you fail a math test and to top it all off your fish dies! Sometimes everything just seems to go wrong but when we know Jesus, the way we see our problems can change. This week, in Acts, Paul was shipwrecked, bitten by a poisonous snake and was put in a house he was told he could never leave! Watch this week’s video lesson to learn about how Paul focused on God and not his own problems through faith in knowing that there is a grand plan that only He knows.</p>

<p>Also, this week is Birthday Club so if you have an August birthday, make sure you join us for a button and a cookie!!</p>

<p><strong>We have no attachments because we are inviting you to come to Daybreak Church this Sunday for your very own children’s programming (1st-5th grade) in the amphitheater! We have room for 35 kids each service, so come ready with some sunscreen and hats in the 80 degree weather!</strong></p>

<p><em>“For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ- with all boldness and without hindrance!” Acts 28:30-31</em></p>
