  **Chandler Corzine** **-** Daybreak Church Young Adult Pastor

  My passion is to see Young Adults encounter Jesus personally and in community because that same encounter changed my life when I was 20. I love this season of life and the ups and downs that come with it. For me, the identity formation happening throughout our 20’s is the foundation we build our future upon. When I’m not working, I love watching sports and spending time with Golden Retriever, Belli. I can’t wait to meet you and hear your story!
