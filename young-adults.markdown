  **Chandler Corzine** **-** Daybreak Church Young Adult Pastor

  My passion is to see Young Adults encounter Jesus personally and in community because that same encounter changed my life when I was 20. I love this season of life and the ups and downs that come with it. For me, the identity formation happening throughout our 20’s is the foundation we build our future upon. When I’m not working, I love watching sports and spending time with my fiancé, and my Golden Retriever, Belli. I can’t wait to meet you and hear your story!

**Who We Are**: Daybreak Young Adults (Daybreak YA) is a collective community of young adults (18-30) gathering together to create a home for the young adults of North County San Diego. We want every young adult to experience the radical hope and healing of Jesus through personal relationship, communal living, and the simplicity of day to day life. Join us on Monday Nights at 7pm at the chapel!
