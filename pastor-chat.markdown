Are you new to Daybreak? Would you like to learn more about our church? 

Pastor's Chat is an informal lunch where you'll get to meet and interact with Pastor Jason, some of our staff and other people that are new to Daybreak, just like you. It's a great first step in getting connected. Childcare and lunch will be provided.

If you're interest in signing up for a future Pastor's Chat please contact <laura@daybreakchurch.org>
