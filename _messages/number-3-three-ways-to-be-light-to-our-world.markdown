THREE WAYS TO BE LIGHT TO OUR WORLD

2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self- discipline.

Mark 4:35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” 36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. 38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” 39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. 40 He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?” 41 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”

PRAY WITH AND FOR PEOPLE

Ephesians 5:15-16 Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.

BE GENEROUS AND SHARE OUR STUFF

Proverbs 11:25 A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.
REPLACE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH ENCOURAGING WORDS
Ephesians 5:11Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.

Romans 15:5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
