Baptism is an important step in your journey as a follower of Christ and an outward symbol of the work He has already done in your life. The Bible paints a beautiful picture of baptism as our identification with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection. When you make the decision to accept Christ as your Savior, the Bible says that your old way of life is dead, and you are beginning a new life with Christ.

Accepting Christ as your Savior means you believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins and that by His death and bodily resurrection, He bridged the gap between you and God for all time. If you have come to this point in your spiritual journey, you are ready to be baptized. At Daybreak, our church family comes together on this special occasion to celebrate your commitment to your new life in Christ.

> *Or have you forgotten that when we became Christians and were baptized to become one with Christ Jesus, we died with Him? For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.*

> Romans 6:3-4

##### BAPTISM IS AN ALL CHURCH EVENT

At Daybreak we have baptism celebrations a number of times each year. We encourage the whole church to come out and celebrate as people of all ages make this public commitment.

**Our next Baptism is coming up on September 12, 2021**
